    "## Types of ML Algorithms:\n",
    "1. Supervised learning: \n",
    "    - we train the program on previously known (labelled) data\n",
    "    - after train, we expect it to make prediction on new data\n",
    "    - ex. regression, classification\n",
    "2. Unsepervised learning:\n",
    "    - we leave the program to find patterns in data\n",
    "    - ex. clustering analysis, dimensionality reduction\n",
    "3. Reinforcement learning:\n",
    "    - a form of unsupervised learning\n",
    "    - the program learns continuously\n",
    "    - ex. learn to play a game by observing other players, learning to drive a car\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithms by Task:\n",
    "- Statistical algorithms\n",
    "- Regression: prediction a continuous variable\n",

    "### Example: Preparing Data for Modelling\n",
    "- Most models require two additional steps:\n",
    "    - 1. COnvert categorical variables into indicato variables:\n",
    "        - dataset = pd.get_dummies(dataset_\n",
    "     - 2. Normalize values: if needed (e.g.scale all variables from 0 to 1 using min-max scaling, or use Z-scores)\n",
    "- Perform other model-specific transformations:\n",
    "    - e.g. your model may not work well with highly imbalanced data (when you look for anomalie)\n",
    "- If possible, prepare several versions of the dataset\n",
    "    - to see how transformation affects model performance\n",
    "- **Describe and document the entire process!**\n",
    "    - don't forget the rules for reproducible research\n",

    "### AzureML\n",
    "- [Microsoft Azure ML Studio](https://studio.azureml.net/)\n",
    "- good for a demo if you're not experienced in coding\n",
    "- Pros:\n",
    "    - free to try\n",
    "    - easy, visual representation of the workflow\n",
    "    - has many predefined modules, can also execute Python code\n",
    "    - runs on the cloud - no need to throttle your machine\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Cons:\n",
    "    - hides away or obscures some important implementation details\n",
    "    - runnng on the cloud is too expensive sometimes"
